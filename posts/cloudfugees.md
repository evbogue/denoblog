It's a dayold story today, but I want to reiterate it because I think it will have a deeper meaning over the next couple of years or decades or whatever. 

Everyone has a computer in their pocket so why can't we talk to each other using our computers?

The simple answer is of course NAT (NETWORK ADDRESS TRANSLATION) which is something that ISPs (INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS) use to lease you an Internet address that is unstable and thus makes it difficult to send a direct message to your computer.

One might imagine there are alternate universes out there where I send a message from my computer to my phone, and from my phone to my friend's phone. If my friend's phone is right there, then it reaches out and the message traverses the small space via wifi or if bluetooth would ever work then bluetooth.

But that world doesn't exist. Why? Because of THE CLOUD. Which is a dark and mysterious scam that involves a lot of investors and a handful of CEOs and a few tech companies on the west coast that want you to bank all of your data with them in the form of EMAILS that the you have received and probably some other rows and tables in a MySQL databse that would probably fit on your phone if you downloaded it.

Will we ever break free from this horrible way of doing things? Probably not. Ten years ago maybe, but these days the tech talent is so limited in the space and they are clinging to their desks in the cloud (while working from home! wow!) that I think we will never have this future without direct user input. No one will ever do it for us. We have to do it for ourselves. And to do it for ourselves we need to learn how to code and all of that. 

And who can be fucked to do that post-CovID+++?

So we remain prisoners of the dark cloud that has probably already destroyed our society as we know it.
