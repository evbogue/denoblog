Sorry I haven't updated my blog! After I pushed the last blog post my phone was buzzing so much I was too distracted to sit down and think.

Which I guess illustrates why people like having their phone buzz, it is a great distraction from reality. You need to go get groceries, you need to make dinner, you need to update your blog, you need to track down that stupid bug in bogbook where people's names aren't being sent around for some reason, and all you manage to do that week is track down the stupid bug! And I forgot to mention all of the times that I went to to work this week, which was a lot.

But anyway, I am blogging again, and that is the good news. The bad news is what am I going to blog about? Elon Musk? Kanye West? Bogbook? CovID+++?

I fully expected a CovID+++ resurgence as soon as the midterm elections were over, and was I right? Yup, the virus waits until the midterms are over so that it is not involved in election interferance. This bug is so compassionate towards democracy! I fully expect the holiday season to be full of CovID+++ scaremongering for the next 16 years, just as it has been for the past three.

But what am I going to write about? The same things I always write about I guess.

Some people asked about Bogbook over the past week. Some of them tried it. 

Will you give it a try? https://bogbook.com/ 

Whenever you post my phone will buzz.

Now let me fix that bug where the posts aren't immediately showing up when you first load bogbook from those ntfy links.
