title: Sorry I didn't update my blog yesterday

I had a blogging streak, and I missed it. I know, it was on my mind all day long. I kept trying to think of what to blog about, but there were so many other things that I had to do yesterday that in combination of not knowing what to blog about and not having the time to sit down and blog about it, I was unable to update my blog.

I know you're disappointed, but not as disappointed as me. As I've said on this blog many times, a non-updated blog is a dead blog, and a dead blog is just like almost all of the other blogs on the Internet. My blog is different, because it is updated.

And so I am going to backdate this post to yesterday so that it looks like I blogged yesterday, even though I didn't.

But what should I blog about today? It is your turn to weigh in. If I had comments you could leave them below, but I haven't figured out how to have comments yet. You could email me with your suggestions [ev@evbogue.com](mailto:ev@evbogue.com) or leave your comments on [bogbook](https://denobook.com/).
