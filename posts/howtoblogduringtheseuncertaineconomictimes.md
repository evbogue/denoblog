Sometimes people wonder how to blog during these uncertain economic times. I mean nothing is really guaranteed, and things aren't like they used to be. There is a war on, and that might change things. Silicon Valley is dead, and the stock market hasn't quite corrected yet, and the currency is lower against something else. It might make it hard to blog during these uncertain times, because what will happen if I do?

It can be hard to blog during these uncertain economic times. You might check the stock market and it is way down, or check the stock market and it is way up. Or you check the stocks and they are up, but the market is down. Or maybe you check them against something else and see that something has changed and you might wonder whether it is the time be to blogging if things are the way that they are. 

And so you get in your car and drive in circles, looking for the next opportunity.

And you blog sits there, unpublished to.

And no one reads it. And no one SUBSCRIBES to it. And no one listens to what you are saying across the Internet because you just let those uncertain times get to you to the point that you are not blogging today. Instead, what are you doing? Driving in circles, running down your tires, burning gasoline, and thinking that maybe if you just drive enough that things will become certain again. Well, I can tell you that it doesn't matter whether you are driving this way or that way, you will find that driving in endless circles does not make things more certain. 

In fact, cars are a big killer of humans on a daily basis. I'd check the stats, but I imagine that more people die from cars than from most things. We should ban cars, and that will definitely keep the germs from spreading as fast as they currently do. Well, they will still spread by planes, but at least they won't spread by cars. And then we can live in tiny little towns where we can only visit each other if we find some other way of visiting besides by driving. That'll make things more certain!

But all of that is beside the point. The point that I am trying to make is that you are not blogging because you are not blogging, and the uncertain times don't matter to your blog because your blog is very easy to update, it just requires a tiny bit of programming knowledge or you can get a centralized blog from a Silicon Valley company and update that for a year or two until they don't quite IPO and start throwing popups in front of all your posts. 

What I'm trying to tell you is you should try blogging, whether or not you agree with me that the times are uncertain at least you blogged. Because if you didn't blog today then what did you do?
